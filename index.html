      <p>A Text Adventure</p>

    <section>

      <div class="toggle" style="margin:auto;">Click here to begin.</div>
      <div class="module" style="margin:auto;">
        <p>You failed a History test. If your parents find out, they might get mad at you. What do you do?</p>
        <div class="toggle">Show your parents your test.</div>
        <div class="module">
          <p>Your parents get mad at you and send you to your room for time out. Now what?</p>
          <div class="toggle">Stay in time out.</div>
          <div class="module">
            <p>Soon, time out is over. Your parents apologize for their emotional lapse, but there's a catch.</p>
            <p>"You need a History tutor," your dad says.</p>
            <p>You respond:</p>
            <div class="toggle">"Good idea!"</div>
            <div class="module">
              <p>And so, your dad gets a tutor, who shows up the next day. The tutor is friendly, but you seem to have a
                hard time understanding what he says. Still, you persevere and end up with a B+ on the next History
                test.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="toggle">"I don't think it's necessary."</div>
            <div class="module">
              <p>"Really?" your dad replies. "Tutors help a lot, you know."</p>
              <div class="toggle">"I think I can handle things myself."</div>
              <div class="module">
                <p>Your dad thinks about your reasoning.</p>
                <p>"You know, you're right," he confesses. "I overreacted about a single test."</p>
                <p>"Just don't give up and do your best," your mom adds. "Then you will become a History superstar
                  student."</p>
                <p>To make a long story short, you follow your mom's advice, netting yourself an A on the next
                  History test. Congrats, superstar!</p>
              </div>
              <div class="toggle">"How about get a video game with the money you would have spent?"</div>
              <div class="module">
                <p>"You know, that's a pretty good point." your dad winks. "Why waste hard earned money on boring
                  academic stuff when we can have TONS of fun instead?"</p>
                <p>And so, before your mom can protest, your dad bolts straight to the store and heads back with an
                  assortment of video games randomly selected from the shelves. You and your dad, who seems to have
                  completely forgotten about the History test, proceed to have an absolute blast binging through all
                  these games. Your dopamine levels may have soared, but your History grade, not so much.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="toggle">Escape time out through a window.</div>
          <div class="module">
            <p>You successfully escape without your parents knowing! Now that you're out, what do you do?</p>
            <div class="toggle">Run away.</div>
            <div class="module">
              <p>You don't know where you're going, but you keep on running, and running.</p>
              <p>Several minutes later, you catch your breath next to the grocery store. As you walk
                around...wait, is that your mom inside the store?</p>
              <div class="toggle">Get the hell outta here.</div>
              <div class="module">
                <p>Immediately, you make another run for it. Unfortunately, that's when you trip over the nearby Girl
                  Scout cookie stand! Not only did you frighten yourself and a group of girls, your mom catches you
                  red-handed, and you now owe $100 in broken cookie boxes.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="toggle">Confront your mom.</div>
              <div class="module">
                <p>Whelp, here goes nothing. You head into the grocery store, making your way towards your mom. She
                  focuses so much on her shopping list for a moment, you find yourself standing directly behind her
                  without her noticing.</p>
                <p>Finally, your mom looks behind.</p>
                <p>At first, she stares at you, eyes popped, jaw fully dropped. Then came the words.</p>
                <p>"Color me impressed."</p>
                <p>Wait, what?</p>
                <p>"If only I KNEW you could sprint FIVE MILES that quickly! That, in my eyes, is something remarkable."
                </p>
                <p>Your mom drives you home, more cheery than usual. The next thing you know, you're signed up for your
                  school's Cross Country team.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="toggle">Go to your friend's house.</div>
            <div class="module">
              <p>Your friend appears to be excited when you stop by his house.</p>
              <p>"Come on in!" he says. "Let's play some violent video games!"</p>
              <div class="toggle">"Sure thing, man!"</div>
              <div class="module">
                <p>"Booyah!" your friend cheers, powering on his game system.</p>
                <p>You and your friend have a fun time playing multiplayer mode on a first-person shooter video game.
                  But
                  then...</p>
                <p>"WHAT'S GOING ON?!" yells your friend's mom, frantically running to the video game room. "You know
                  the family rules: NO inviting friends WITHOUT my permission! Your friend must GO!!"</p>
                <p>"Sorry," your friend says to you.</p>
                <div class="toggle">Leave your friend's house.</div>
                <div class="module">
                  <p>"I apologize," you respond, as you walk your way out of your friend's house.</p>
                  <p>That's when you notice your dad's car directly in front of you. Your friend's mom must have called
                    your parents.</p>
                  <p>Following "the talk," you're only allowed to play Early Childhood rated games for the next two
                    weeks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="toggle">Try to convince your friend's mom for you to stay.</div>
                <div class="module">
                  <p>Your friend's mom glares at you.</p>
                  <p>"Hmmph, this had better be good!" she glowers.</p>
                  <div class="toggle">"I really want to socialize with my friend."</div>
                  <div class="module">
                    <p>"Well if you want to socialize," your friend's mom remarks, "you can do it outside!!"</p>
                    <p>You and your friend agree, leave the house and chat around the block.</p>
                    <p>Carried away by the conversation, you and your friend unwittingly pass by your parents' house.
                      Unfortunately, your dad's lounging by the front porch...</p>
                    <p>"Alright, what were you talking about?" your dad angrily prods as he drags you back in. Then he
                      suddenly grins. "Wait, actually: what AM I talking about?"</p>
                    <p>For the next two weeks, your dad will only speak to you in Morse code.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="toggle">"We're studying for a History test."</div>
                  <div class="module">
                    <p>Your friend's mom points towards the TV. "Ok, then explain THIS!!" she sneers.</p>
                    <p>"Well, you see, Mom," your friend jumps in, "this game's all about World War II. We're learning
                      about all the artillery and strategies the troops dealt with back then!"</p>
                    <p>Your friend's mom glances back and forth at the TV and you and your friend's grimaces.</p>
                    <p>"Alright, I'll let this one slide," she sighs. "But just this once!"</p>
                    <p>You and your friend resume playing for hours on end. Soon enough, both of you get tired, and
                      you need to return home.</p>
                    <p>"I'm taking you back!" your friend's mom states firmly. "You ain't walking in the dark!"</p>
                    <p>That's when you remember: you're supposed to still be in time out! How would you explain suddenly
                      appearing at the front door with your friend's mom?</p>
                    <div class="toggle">Plead the fifth.</div>
                    <div class="module">
                      <p>Your friend's mom rings the doorbell. Your sleepy dad answers the door.</p>
                      <p>Not a single word is said as you head back to bed. For the next several days, you don't hear
                        anything from your parents regarding the History test or the time out.</p>
                      <p>Don't ask, don't tell.</p>

                      <p>Your friend's mom rings the doorbell. Your sleepy dad answers the door.</p>
                      <p>"I'm really sorry, dad!" you apologize. "I escaped your time out and went to my friend's house
                        to play video games!"</p>
                      <p>Your dad's befuddled at first, until suddenly, he awakens.</p>
                      <p>"That's right, you ARE supposed to be in time out," he says. "And I'M supposed to give you a
                        punishment!"</p>
                      <p>Your punishment is to buy your dad his cup of coffee every day for the next two weeks.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="toggle">"I promise I'll cook dinner for your family tonight."</div>
                  <div class="module">
                    <p>"Deal!" your friend's mom beams. She leaves the room, gleefully humming.</p>
                    <p>"Dude, what the hell?" your friend exclaims. "Alright, I can't leave this to you alone!"</p>
                    <p>For the next hour, you and your friend prepare a fried rice dinner. As you head to the dining
                      table, you're shocked to find unexpected guests: your parents.</p>
                    <p>"I just HAD to invite them so they can be proud of you!" your friend's mom comments.</p>
                    <p>After the awkward dinner, your parents take you home with a strange grin on their faces. When you
                      wake up the next day, you notice a thank you card from your parents right by your slightly-ajar
                      window.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="toggle">"Nah, not in the mood today."</div>
              <div class="module">
                <p>"Fair enough," your friend responds. "Then do you just want to chat or something?"</p>
                <div class="toggle">"Sure. That's why I came."</div>
                <div class="module">
                  <p>"Ok then," your friend says. "But we gotta whisper and hide. My mom has a rule that I cannot invite
                    friends without her permission."</p>
                  <p>And so, you and your friend hide in your friend's room, whispering a great conversation.
                    Unfortunately, you hear footsteps.</p>
                  <p>"Uh oh, that could be my mom. I'm busted!" your friend whispers to you.</p>
                  <div class="toggle">Hide underneath your friend's bed.</div>
                  <div class="module">

                  <p>Your mom follows suit, and you're home alone. Later that night, a pair of burglars show up...</p>

                  <p>"Yeah!" your mom affirms.</p>
